🔍 Exploring U.S. School Data with Python 📊
I recently worked on a data exploration project using a dataset of U.S. schools from the 2016–17 academic year. Using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn, I performed:
 ✅ Data loading and cleaning
 ✅ Summary statistics and missing value handling
 ✅ Visualizations:
Bar & line charts showing the number of schools by state
Pie chart highlighting the top 5 states
Heatmap of numeric correlations
Boxplots to detect outliers
Scatter plot and pair plot for deeper insights
📈 This exercise helped me understand how to gain insights from raw data and visualize trends effectively. It’s a great reminder of how powerful Python is in the world of data analysis!
